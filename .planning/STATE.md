# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** The 1-bit dithered 3D rendering — a visually striking, modern take on retro aesthetics that makes the game instantly recognizable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Graphics API: OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile (macOS caps at 4.1; research recommended 4.6 but 4.1 is the ceiling on this platform)
- Dithering approach: Post-process fullscreen quad with Bayer matrix; world-space pattern anchoring is non-negotiable from Phase 1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- macOS OpenGL cap at 4.1: Research recommended OpenGL 4.6 but macOS only supports 4.1 Core Profile. Phase 1 planning must confirm all required features are available in 4.1 (FBOs, GLSL 4.10, fullscreen quads — all confirmed available).
