## Project

**3D Roguelike**

A first-person 3D psychological horror game built on a custom C++ engine. The player explores a mechanical prison environment, investigating recordings, scratch marks, and environmental clues while manipulating doors, cameras, and control terminals to progress through interconnected cell blocks.

**Core Value:** The Stanley Parable-inspired art style — clean, minimalist environments with warm soft lighting, muted color palette, and stylized realism. Geometric clarity over visual clutter. Institutional/corporate aesthetic applied to a prison setting creates an eerie, liminal atmosphere.

### Art Direction

- **Style reference**: The Stanley Parable / Ultra Deluxe — clean surfaces, warm lighting, slightly surreal atmosphere
- **Color palette**: Muted warm tones — beiges, warm grays, soft yellows, desaturated accents
- **Lighting**: Soft, warm, atmospheric — not harsh or dramatic. Subtle shadows, ambient occlusion
- **Textures**: Clean and readable — procedural patterns (stone, wood, brick, metal) without heavy grunge
- **Geometry**: Clear shapes, clean lines, moderate detail — stylized realism, not photorealistic
- **Mood**: Slightly eerie liminal space quality — institutional, oppressive but not dark

### Constraints

- **Engine**: Custom C++ — no Unity/Unreal/Godot
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile (macOS caps at 4.1; all shaders target GLSL 4.10)
- **Platform**: Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)

## Technology Stack

## Recommended Stack
### Core Technologies
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| C++20 | C++20 standard | Implementation language | `std::span`, concepts, designated initializers, and constexpr improvements pay off in engine code; EnTT 3.x requires C++20; broadly supported on all target compilers (MSVC 2019+, GCC 10+, Clang 12+) |
| CMake | 3.28+ | Build system | De-facto standard for cross-platform C++ projects; best ecosystem support for GLFW, Jolt, EnTT; FetchContent simplifies vendoring; VS Code and CLion integration is first-class |
| OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile | 4.1 | Graphics API | Practical ceiling set by macOS (Apple deprecated OpenGL at 4.1); HDR scene rendering with ACES tonemapping via fullscreen post-process passes; Vulkan complexity would dominate the schedule without visual benefit |
| GLFW | 3.4 (released Feb 2024) | Window creation, OpenGL context, input | Focused and minimal — exactly what a custom engine needs; callback-based input maps cleanly to an event bus architecture; 12ms window creation vs SDL's 45ms; no audio/networking bloat; 3.4 adds runtime platform selection and Wayland support |
| GLAD 2 | v2.0.8 (released Sep 2025) | OpenGL function loader | Modern replacement for GLEW; generates only the extension set you request; supports OpenGL Core profile natively without the `glewExperimental` workaround GLEW needs; GLAD 2 adds Vulkan/EGL support if the API is ever extended |
| GLM | 1.0.3 (released Dec 2025) | Math: vectors, matrices, quaternions | Header-only; syntax mirrors GLSL exactly, which matters when writing shader-side math alongside CPU-side transforms; the only maintained C++ math lib with full GLSL spec coverage; 1.0.x branch supports C++17/20 |
| EnTT | v3.16.0 (released Nov 2025) | Entity-Component System (ECS) | Used in Minecraft; header-only; archetype-sparse-set hybrid delivers cache-friendly iteration; component queries are composable at compile time; forces clean separation between game state and rendering |
### Post-Processing / Rendering Support
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| GLSL (via OpenGL) | 4.10 | Shader language | All shaders use `#version 410 core` (macOS ceiling); scene rendering + post-process passes as fullscreen fragment shaders; GLSL is the only choice when targeting OpenGL |
| stb_image | 2.30 (latest as of master, 2024-07) | PNG/JPG texture loading | Single-header, zero-dependency, public domain; the standard choice for loading textures in custom engines; stb_image.h + STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION is all that is needed |
| stb_truetype | latest master | Font rasterization for HUD/debug text | Same family as stb_image; renders TTF glyphs to a bitmap atlas at startup; sufficient for in-game UI text in a roguelike |
### Physics / Collision
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Jolt Physics | v5.4.0 (released Sep 2025) | Rigid body physics, collision detection, raycasting | Modern C++17/20 design; multi-threaded; used in Horizon Forbidden West and Death Stranding 2; significantly better API design and performance than Bullet3; excellent documentation; MIT license; character controller included — important for first-person movement |
### Audio
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| OpenAL Soft | v1.25.1 (released Jan 2025) | 3D positional audio | Cross-platform implementation of the OpenAL API; spatial audio out of the box (torches crackling as the player approaches is a natural fit for the gothic setting); LGPL license; the community standard for spatial audio in custom C++ game engines |
### Development / Debugging
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Dear ImGui | v1.92.6 (released Feb 2025) | In-engine debug UI | Industry standard debug overlay; integrates with any OpenGL+GLFW setup via provided backends; invaluable for inspecting ECS component state, tweaking material parameters, and visualizing AI patrol paths at runtime |
| spdlog | v1.x latest | Structured logging | Header-only fast logger; fmt-backed formatting; used everywhere in the C++ gamedev community; category sinks let you filter rendering vs AI vs audio logs separately |

## Alternatives Considered
| Recommended | Alternative | When to Use Alternative Instead |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| OpenGL 4.1 | Vulkan | If GPU-driven rendering for thousands of draw calls is needed — not applicable here |
| OpenGL 4.1 | WebGPU (via wgpu/Dawn) | If a web/browser deployment target is added later |
| GLFW | SDL3 | SDL3's new GPU API is compelling if you need its audio, networking, and 2D renderer too; for a custom engine where each subsystem is deliberately chosen, GLFW's focus is a better fit |
| Jolt Physics | Bullet3 | Bullet3 is fine if you already have code using it; Jolt has a cleaner API and better documentation for greenfield; no reason to choose Bullet3 for a new project |
| OpenAL Soft | miniaudio | miniaudio is a simpler single-header solution; choose it if you need audio at all but want zero dependencies; OpenAL Soft wins when 3D positional audio matters, which it does for dungeon atmosphere |
| EnTT | Flecs | Flecs has a richer query language and built-in pipeline scheduling; switch to it if the ECS becomes the architectural bottleneck; EnTT is simpler to start with |
| CMake | xmake | xmake is cleaner syntax and includes package management; switch if CMake's verbosity becomes intolerable; xmake has a smaller ecosystem and some libraries don't yet provide native xmake support |
| Dear ImGui (debug only) | No in-game UI | For the final shipped game, ImGui is stripped out; any in-game HUD is custom-rendered using stb_truetype glyphs — keep it minimal |
## What NOT to Use
| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| GLEW | Stagnant since 2.2.0 (2017); requires `glewExperimental = GL_TRUE` for Core profile contexts; no GLAD 2-era features | GLAD v2 |
| SDL2 audio subsystem | Mixed audio quality; audio is not SDL2's strength | OpenAL Soft |
| Assimp (for new code) | Already used (v6.0.4) for FBX import and multi-format support, but prefer tinygltf for new glTF-only loading paths — Assimp is heavy (1M+ lines) and fragile to build | tinygltf for new glTF paths; keep Assimp for FBX/legacy |
| Unity / Unreal / Godot | Explicitly out of scope per project requirements; custom engine gives direct FBO and shader control needed for the rendering pipeline | Custom C++ + OpenGL (as specified) |
| Bullet3 | Last meaningful update was 2022; development is effectively frozen; Jolt Physics is its modern successor | Jolt Physics v5 |
| OpenGL compatibility profile | Allows deprecated immediate-mode calls to leak in; makes porting to Vulkan harder; produces driver-specific behavior differences | OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile only |
| Boost | Enormous dependency for utility functions that C++20 STL now provides; adds significant compile time | C++20 STL (`std::span`, `std::ranges`, `std::format`) |
## Stack Patterns by Variant
- Replace OpenGL 4.1 with Metal (via the `metal-cpp` header-only wrapper from Apple)
- Or use MoltenVK to run Vulkan on Metal
- OpenGL on macOS is deprecated at 4.1 — Apple has not updated it since 2018
- Replace OpenGL 4.1 + GLFW with WebGPU (Emscripten's built-in WebGPU support)
- Replace OpenAL Soft with the Web Audio API via Emscripten
- EnTT, GLM, and Jolt all have WASM-compatible builds
## Version Compatibility
| Package | Requires | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| EnTT v3.16.0 | C++20 | The `entt::handle` API requires C++20 concepts |
| Jolt Physics v5.4.0 | C++17 minimum, C++20 recommended | Uses `std::span`, `std::bit_cast`; enable `JPH_USE_STD_VECTOR` for STL integration |
| GLM 1.0.3 | C++17 minimum | Branch 1.1 will require C++17; stick with 1.0.x if your CI enforces C++14 |
| Dear ImGui v1.92.6 | C++11 | No C++20 requirement; works with any GLFW+OpenGL backend |
| GLFW 3.4 | CMake 3.16+ | On macOS, requires `-framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL -framework IOKit` link flags |
| OpenAL Soft v1.25.1 | None (dynamic link) | Link as `openal` on Unix; `OpenAL32.lib` on Windows |

## Conventions

### Naming
- **Classes/Structs**: `PascalCase` — `TransformComponent`, `PhysicsSystem`, `RuntimeGameSession`
- **Functions/Methods**: `camelCase` — `isKeyPressed()`, `setCharacterVelocity()`, `loadFromFile()`
- **Variables**: `snake_case` generally; private members use trailing underscore — `window_`, `registry_`
- **Constants**: `k` prefix + PascalCase — `kMaxRenderLights`, `kMaterialKindCount`
- **Enums**: `PascalCase` enum class with `PascalCase` values — `enum class MaterialKind { Stone, Wood, Metal }`
- **Files**: `PascalCase.h` / `PascalCase.cpp` matching the primary class name

### Headers & Includes
- `#pragma once` (no include guards)
- Include order: standard library → third-party (GLAD, GLM, EnTT, spdlog) → project headers
- Project headers use paths relative to `src/` root

### Class Patterns
- Non-copyable by default (explicitly `= delete` copy ctor/assignment)
- Move semantics where ownership transfer is needed
- Pimpl for complex implementations hiding third-party types (`PhysicsSystem` hides Jolt internals)
- RAII for OpenGL resources (destructors clean up VAO/VBO/EBO/FBO)
- Virtual destructors on all base classes (`virtual ~Class() = default;`)

### ECS
- Components are plain-old-data structs (no methods, no inheritance)
- Marker/tag components for entity identification: `PlayerTag`, `ControllableTag`, `PrimaryCameraTag`
- Systems inherit from `System` base class with `init()`, `update()`, `shutdown()`
- Systems are registered with an `UpdatePhase` for execution ordering

### Code Style
- `.clang-format` based on LLVM: 4-space indent, 100-char column limit, attached braces
- Pointer alignment: left (`int* ptr`)
- No short functions on single line

### Build
- CMake with `FetchContent` for most deps; GLFW, GLM, spdlog via Homebrew
- Custom `pixel_roguelike_add_test()` function for test registration
- Tests are standalone executables (no external test framework) — exit code = pass/fail
- Three executables: `pixel-roguelike`, `level-editor`, `procedural-model-viewer`

### Shaders
- GLSL version `#version 410 core` (macOS maximum)
- Engine shaders in `assets/shaders/engine/`, game shaders in `assets/shaders/game/`

## Architecture

### Layered Design
Three layers with strict dependency direction: **Engine → Game → Editor**

### CMake Target Graph
```
pixel-roguelike ──→ gameplay ──→ game_rendering ──→ game_content ──→ engine_rendering ──→ engine_core
level-editor ──→ editor ──→ gameplay                                   engine_ui
procedural-model-viewer ──→ game_rendering                             engine_scene
                                                                       engine_input
                                                                       engine_physics
```

### Engine Layer (`src/engine/`)
- **core/**: `Application` (main loop, system/service registration), `Window` (GLFW), `EventBus` (type-safe pub/sub), `Time`
- **ecs/**: `Registry.h` — thin EnTT wrapper
- **rendering/core/**: `Shader`, `Framebuffer`
- **rendering/geometry/**: `Mesh` (RAII VAO/VBO), `MeshLibrary` (named registry), `Renderer`
- **rendering/assets/**: `AssimpLoader`, `GltfLoader`, `Texture2D`, `TextureCube`
- **rendering/lighting/**: `RenderLight`, `ShadowMap`
- **rendering/post/**: `CompositePass`, `StylizePass`, `SkySettings`
- **input/**: `InputSystem` — GLFW callbacks, cursor lock, accumulated `RuntimeInputState`
- **physics/**: `PhysicsSystem` — Jolt character controller behind pimpl
- **scene/**: `SceneManager`
- **ui/**: `ImGuiLayer`, `Screenshot`

### Game Layer (`src/game/`)
- **components/**: POD structs — `TransformComponent`, `MeshComponent`, `LightComponent`, `CameraComponent`, `CharacterControllerComponent`, `StaticColliderComponent`, `InteractableComponent`, `DoorComponent`, `CheckpointComponent`, `PlayerMovementComponent`, `ViewmodelComponent`, tags
- **content/**: `ContentRegistry` — loads and resolves `MaterialDefinition`, `EnvironmentDefinition`, `WeaponDefinition`, `EnemyDefinition`, `GameplayArchetypeDefinition`
- **level/**: `LevelDef` (data), `LevelBuilder` (spawns entities from def), `LevelLoader` (file I/O)
- **rendering/**: `RuntimeSceneRenderer`, `MaterialLibrary`, `EnvironmentSync`, `MaterialKind` enum (Stone/Wood/Metal/Wax/Moss/Viewmodel/Floor/Brick)
- **systems/**: `PlayerMovementSystem`, `CameraSystem`, `RenderSystem`, `DoorSystem`, `CheckpointSystem`, `InteractionSystem`, `InventorySystem`
- **runtime/**: `RuntimeGameSession` (play-session orchestrator), `RuntimeGameplay`, `RuntimeInputState`
- **session/**: `RunSession` (persistent state), `EquipmentState`
- **scenes/**: `CathedralScene`, `SilosCloisterScene`
- **prefabs/**: `GameplayPrefabs` — spawns composite entities (doors, checkpoints)

### Editor Layer (`src/editor/`)
- **scene/**: `EditorSceneDocument` — scene graph with parent/child hierarchy, world transforms, serialization
- **core/**: `EditorCommand` (undo/redo), `LevelEditorCore` (dock layout), layout presets, preview sessions
- **viewport/**: `EditorViewportController` — camera orbit, ImGuizmo gizmos
- **ui/**: Inspector, outliner, environment panel, asset browser
- **render/**: Scene and asset preview renderers

### Execution Model
Systems execute in phase order per frame:
`Input → Interaction → Physics → Gameplay → Camera → Render`

Services are registered via type-safe service locator on `Application` (`emplaceService<T>()` / `getService<T>()`).

### Key Data Flows
- **Level loading**: `.scene` file → `LevelDef` struct → `LevelBuilder` spawns ECS entities → systems operate on components
- **Rendering**: `RuntimeSceneRenderer` queries ECS for mesh/light/camera components → scene pass to FBO → stylize post-pass → composite to screen
- **Materials**: `ContentRegistry` resolves `MaterialDefinition` (with parent inheritance) → shader uniforms set per `MaterialKind`
- **Editor round-trip**: `EditorSceneDocument` ↔ `LevelDef` ↔ `.scene` file; preview spawns temporary `RuntimeGameSession`

### Assets Layout
```

├── meshes/       .glb files (arch, pillar, door, hand, dagger)

## Editor Debug Harness

When debugging editor issues (gizmo bugs, selection problems, undo/redo, camera behavior), use the **debug harness** — a Unix socket remote control system in `src/editor/debug/` that lets you programmatically inspect and manipulate the running editor.

- **Socket:** `/tmp/pixel-roguelike-editor-{pid}.sock` (find with `ls /tmp/pixel-roguelike-editor-*.sock`)
- **Protocol:** Line-delimited JSON — `{"id": 1, "cmd": "inspect.entities", "args": {}}`
- **33 commands:** `inspect.*` (read-only state queries), `command.*` (mutating actions), `record.*`/`replay.*` (session capture)
- **Key commands:** `inspect.entities`, `command.select_entity`, `command.focus_entity`, `command.gizmo_drag`, `command.wait_events`, `inspect.gizmo_detailed`

Always prefer the harness over guessing or asking the user to reproduce. See the full command reference in memory (`editor_debug_harness.md`).

<!-- GSD:workflow-start source:GSD defaults -->
## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd:quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd:debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd:execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
